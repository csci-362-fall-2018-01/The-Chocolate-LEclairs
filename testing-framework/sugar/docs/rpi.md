Raspberry Pi are a series of small, low cost, low power computers.

Sugar can be run on a Raspberry Pi. You will need a display, keyboard and mouse.

As of August 2017, the best to use is Sugar on a Stick, as it has many activities and has regular security updates. See [Sugar on a Stick](rpi-soas.md) for how to download and install it. Sugar on a Stick is a spin of Fedora.

Other methods are;

-   using [Fedora](fedora.md),
-   using [Debian](debian.md),
-   using [Ubuntu](ubuntu.md).

Developers may focus on either Fedora or Debian when [setting up a development environment](development-environment.md) for Sugar on Raspberry Pi, because Sugar development on generic computers is focused on those operating systems.
