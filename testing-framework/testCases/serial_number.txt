# Serial Number Gen Test Case
# This test case tests the serial generator
# Their generator uses python's random and unix time, so we can seed the random and use time the same way they do to replicate random generation
#
# test number: 10
# component: jarabe.util.normalize
# method: normalize_string
# output: random string with unix time appended
# 
# first line is the seed
# second line is the string it should generate
