# Deliverable 3
Deliverable 3 included our testing framework architecture as well as the layout for our test cases. You can look in this document to 
see what the expected input and output is for each of the test cases. Also included in deliverable 3 are 5 completed test cases for
the sugar labs system. You can view the descriptions as well as the input for the test cases in 'testing-framework/testCases/'.
The executable scripts to run each test case can be found in 'testing-framework/testCaseExecutables/'<br>
