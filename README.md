# Description
This repository is for our CSCI-362 class. you will find a testing framework to test the sugarlabs system.
 You can also read through the final project pdf or the individual deliverables for instructions on how to 
 build sugarlabs and how to execute the tests.

# Final Report
Formal report for all 5 deliverables as well as a sixth chapter for reflections on the project<br>

# Deliverable 1
Deliverable 1 give instructions on how to build sugarlabs after cloning the original repository. It gives details on all the commands
to execute in the terminal as well as all the libraries that will be needed for a successful build. <br>

# Deliverable 2
Deliverable 2 shows the test plan that we will be following for building the test framework as well as the later deliverables in the class. <br>

# Deliverable 3
Deliverable 3 included our testing framework architecture as well as the layout for our test cases. You can look in this document to 
see what the expected input and output is for each of the test cases. Also included in deliverable 3 are 5 completed test cases for
the sugar labs system. You can view the descriptions as well as the input for the test cases in 'testing-framework/testCases/'.
The executable scripts to run each test case can be found in 'testing-framework/testCaseExecutables/'<br>

# Deliverable 4
Deliverable 4 works off of Deliverable 3, completing all 25 of the test cases specified in our testing framework. This document will show all of the same details as Deliverable 3, those being the input and output of each test case, the tested component, the tested method, and the test id number. The executable scripts for running the test cases are found in the same directory as before. <br>

# Deliverable 5
Deliverable 5 is where we have injected faults into Sugar Labs' code in order to make atleast 5 of our previously successful test cases fail. In this report you will be able to see the exact changes that we made, the test cases that fail because of the changes and how you can run the injected code test cases yourself <br>
